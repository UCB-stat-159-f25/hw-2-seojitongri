This repository is public so that Binder can find it.  
All code and data are based on the original LIGO Center for Open Science Tutorial Repository.  
This repository is a class exercise that restructures the original LIGO code for improved reproducibility,  
as a homework assignment for the Fall 2025 installment of UC Berkeley’s Stat 159/259 course,  
_Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science_.  
Authorship of the original analysis code rests with the LIGO collaboration.
